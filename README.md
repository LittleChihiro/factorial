# factorial
In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n:

```
 n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x (n-3) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1
```
For example,
```
5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
```

**Task:**

Write the logical algorithm and the code in JavaScript that takes one integer number and returns the factorial of that number.
